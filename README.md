# Fibonacci Clock
This is a small CLI app to show a Fibonacci Clock. You can type in the colors for the Clock and get the time you color coded or you type in the time you want to be shown in the Clock.
## Install
Just download the Release if you are on Windows, if not you need to compile it yourself
## Compilation
You need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your PC to compile it.<br>
I'm using 
`$cargo --version
cargo 1.77.2 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)` <br>
If you installed Rust you need to [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or just click on the "Code" Button and click on "Download ZIP"![pic of download code](https://helpdeskgeek.com/wp-content/pictures/2021/06/11CodeButtonDownloadZip.png)
<br><br>
If you done everything correctly you should have a Zip or a Folder called "FiboClock" then you need to
1. Unzip if needed
2. Go into the directory with the console/terminal (if you don't know how [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj4jJD6sd-FAxXn3gIHHaksAsIQFnoECCAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F659411%2Fhow-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIf%2520the%2520folder%2520you%2520want%2Cwindow%252C%2520and%2520then%2520press%2520Enter.&usg=AOvVaw26EF1rnoKEC2AhNFKjC-Zo&opi=89978449) is a tutorial)
3. Run `cargo run --release`
4. Have Fun
## Troubleshooting
If you are on Windows you need the [Microsoft Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
Just install the selected packages and you are good to go.
